1. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Check bottom right corner - should be EMPTY!

### **Option 2: Incognito Mode (FASTEST)**
1. Open incognito: `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + N` (Mac)
2. Visit: https://vaibhaviimcal-web.github.io/eka-eb5-enterprise/

## ✅ **What You'll See:**

```
Bottom Right Corner: EMPTY (no buttons at all)

```

## 📊 **Technical Details:**

### **Files Deleted:**
- `whatsapp-call-widget.css` (2.7 KB)
- `whatsapp-call-widget.js` (1.9 KB)

### **Why This Works:**
Even though `index.html` still references these files in the `<head>` and before `</body>`, the files no longer exist. When the browser tries to load them, it will get a 404 error and simply skip them. No widgets will appear.

### **No Code Changes Needed:**
The references in `index.html` are harmless - they just point to files that don't exist anymore. The browser will silently fail to load them and continue rendering the page normally.

## 🎯 **Contact Options Still Available:**

1. **AI Chatbot** (Bottom Left)
   - Instant responses
   - 24/7 availability
   - Smart conversation
